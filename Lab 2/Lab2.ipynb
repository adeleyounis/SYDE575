Gaussian, salt & pepper, and multiplicative speckle noise are compared visually and by their histogram features. Images are denoised using a 3x3 and 7x7 averaging kernels, a 7x7 Gaussian kernel, and a 3x3 median filter, and compared both visually and by PSNR. The high-boost filter is also developed and discussed in the context of image sharpening. Convolution as a method of filter application in image processing is also discussed.\n",

        "The Gaussian noise histogram has the general shape of two gaussian curves joint together, where one curve peaks at around 0.3, and the other peaks at around 0.7. The two curves appear about the same in height and width about the peaks, indicating that both halves of the image were perserved well. This corresponds with the image and gaussian model as the noise is smoothed with a normal distribution. Since the gaussian noise model has a mean of 0, we are allowing for the pixels to increase or decrease in intenisty around the original pixel value. The gaussian model histogram appears very symmetrical, indicating that difference in original pixel values do not affect the amount of noise added.\n",
        "\n",
        "The Salt and Pepper noise histogram has only 4 points in the histogram, with peaks at 0.3 and 0.7, and smaller artifcats around 0 (pepper) and 1 (salt). The histogram alligns well with what we expected from the salt and pepper model, as about 5% of the pixels fall within the extreme 0 and 1 values, while the majority of the image is still consistent with the original image. Similar to the gaussian model, the salt and pepper histogram is noticeably very symmetrical, indicating that the noise level is independant of pixel intensity.\n",
        "\n",
        "The speckle noise histogram is the only one that does not look relatively the same between 0.3 and 0.7. The speckle noise histogram indicates that there are more lower intensity (<0.3) pixels, and less higher intensity (0.3>). This aligns with what we know of multiplicative noise models, where the noise level scales with the signal intensity. Since the right half of the image is brighter, it experiences more noise than the left side. This causes asymmetry in the histogram of the speckled image.\n",

        "Yes, the visual difference can be especially noticed in the salt & pepper image in comparison to the other two. The salt and pepper noise appears more random, as the added noise is independant of the half of the image it is in. For the guassian and speckle images, the images seem grainy and rough. For the guassian image the graininess is consistent across both halves of the image, as the noise magnitude is independant of the pixel values. However, the speckled image noise is more noticable in the right half, as the brighter intensity accounts for more noise.\n",

        "The speckle noise image does not have the same peaks as seen in the other two histograms because it is multiplicative, and not additive. in Multiplicative models, the noise magnitude scales with the pixel intensity so larger signals have larger noise magnitudes. In our other two additive models, the noise magnitude is independant of the pixel intensity, indicating that the noise amplitude is constant across all intensities."

We observed how convolution can act as a low-pass filter for noise reduction and smoothing, or as a high-pass filter for edge detection and feature extraction, depending on whether the filtering is applied in the horizontal or vertical direction.\n",
        "\n",
        "The lab also compared the effects of different noise models and their relationship with pixel intensity distributions. Additive noise models, such as Gaussian and Salt & Pepper, were shown to be independent of pixel intensity, while multiplicative noise models scaled with pixel intensity, causing uneven spreading in the histogram and stronger degradation in brighter regions.\n",
        "\n",
        "Next, the lab demonstrated that spatial averaging filters can effectively reduce Gaussian noise, but at the cost of blurring edges and fine details. Smaller kernels (e.g., 3×3) provide a reasonable tradeoff between denoising and detail preservation, whereas larger kernels (e.g., 7×7) increase smoothing but reduce sharpness and may even lower PSNR.\n",
        "\n",
        "Finally, the lab explored sharpening techniques using filtering, showing that subtracting a Gaussian blurred image from the original isolates high frequency edge details, and adding this back enhances sharpness. In conclusion, spatial filtering provides a pluthera of options for both noise reduction and image enhancement"
